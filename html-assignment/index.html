            <P>
            My name is <b>Jenn Hsiang</b>, a student of the <abbr title=" Interactive Media Design">
                     IMD </abbr>Program currently enroll in the Summer Semester. Prior to taking the
                <abbr title=" Interactive Media Design"> IMD </abbr>Program, I was graduated from the
                English for<abbr title=" English for Academic Purpose Program "> EAP </abbr> last
                year. I canâ€™t describe how exciting I am now to enroll in this program after searching for multiple
                courses and was able to make a final decision for myself lately. Not only because <em>online
                    business</em> is already a trend to everyone, but learn how to code/develop along with
                <abbr title="Responsive Web Design"> RWD</abbr> can be efficient and productive in the
                future.
                </P>

                <h3>Hobbys</h3>
                <p>


                    Speaking of hobby, it is broad. Mostly, activities that I love doing in
                    the summer are <em>golfing</em>, <em>boat-fishing</em>, and <em>gardening</em>. I always believe
                    Summer is the most beautiful and wonderful season in Canada even only lasts for few months. In the
                    winter, <em>skiing</em> could be my best option. I have never tried <em> Ice-fishing</em> as it has
                    been on my bucket list for years but would like to try it out this year if possible.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Golfing</li>
                        <li>Boat-fishing</li>
                        <li>Gardening</li>
                        <LI>Skiing</LI>
                    </ul>

</p>
           
                    <p>
                        Nevertheless, life can be various and unpredictable as though this unimaginable pandemic has
                        been impacting us for almost two years. Hopefully, all of us can return to normal life once
                        fully vaccinated in September.
